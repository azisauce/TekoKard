# TekoKard Application

## Architecture Overview

TekoKard is built using a modern client-server architecture, with a Vue.js frontend and Node.js backend. The application follows a clean architecture pattern that separates concerns and maintains a clear data flow.

## Data Flow

### Backend (Server)

The backend follows a layered architecture pattern with the following components:

1. **Controllers** (`/server/src/api/controllers`)
   - Entry point for all HTTP requests
   - Handle request validation
   - Route requests to appropriate services
   - Format and send responses back to the client

2. **Services** (`/server/src/business/services`)
   - Contain business logic
   - Orchestrate data flow between controllers and repositories
   - Handle complex operations and data transformations
   - Implement business rules and validations

3. **Repositories** (`/server/src/data/repositories`)
   - Handle database operations
   - Abstract database access from services
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Map database entities to domain models

4. **Models** (`/server/src/data/models`)
   - Define data structures
   - Represent database schemas
   - Provide data validation rules

### Frontend (Client)

The frontend follows the Vue.js architecture with these key components:

1. **Views** (`/client/src/views`)
   - Page-level components
   - Handle route-level UI logic
   - Compose smaller components

2. **Components** (`/client/src/components`)
   - Reusable UI elements
   - Handle component-level logic
   - Maintain their own state

3. **Services** (`/client/src/services`)
   - Handle API communications
   - Abstract HTTP requests
   - Format data for components

4. **Store** (`/client/src/store`)
   - Manage application state
   - Handle state mutations
   - Provide actions for async operations

5. **Models** (`/client/src/models`)
   - Define client-side data structures
   - Provide data validation
   - Format data for UI

6. **Controllers** (`/client/src/controllers`)
   - Handle complex UI logic
   - Coordinate between components
   - Manage component interactions

## Data Flow Process

1. User interaction triggers an action in a Vue component
2. Component calls appropriate controller/service
3. Frontend service makes API call to backend controller
4. Backend controller validates request and calls service
5. Service processes business logic and calls repository
6. Repository performs database operations
7. Data flows back through the layers
8. Frontend receives response and updates UI

## Development Flow

1. Backend development:
   - Define models in `/server/src/data/models`
   - Implement repositories in `/server/src/data/repositories`
   - Create services in `/server/src/business/services`
   - Set up controllers in `/server/src/api/controllers`

2. Frontend development:
   - Create/update models in `/client/src/models`
   - Implement services in `/client/src/services`
   - Develop components in `/client/src/components`
   - Set up views in `/client/src/views`
   - Configure store in `/client/src/store`
